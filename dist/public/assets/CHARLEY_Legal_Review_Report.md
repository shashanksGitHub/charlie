#### CHARLEY Current:
- **Age Requirement:** 14+ (dating/networking platform)

- Add robust age verification procedures
- Include specific minor protection clauses

- Add specific harassment and abuse prevention clauses

### 4. Enhanced Liability Protections
**Current Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Issue:** Current $100 liability cap insufficient for platform scale.
