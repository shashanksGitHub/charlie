console.log('  ‚Ä¢ No preference OR unlimited ‚Üí Force 25 miles');

console.log('Instead of just excluding people beyond your preference, it REDUCES');

console.log('This is perfect for users who:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Want to avoid long distance relationships completely');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Prefer meeting people they can easily see in person');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Want local connections for practical dating');

console.log('');
console.log('Fields involved:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ distancePreference (user_preferences) - Your original distance setting');
console.log('‚Ä¢ dealBreakers (user_preferences) - Contains "long_distance" if selected');

console.log('');
console.log('The system calculates real distances using Google Places API and');
console.log('applies the reduced distance limit instead of your original preference.');
