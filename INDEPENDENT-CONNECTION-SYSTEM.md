# Independent Connection System Implementation

## Overview
Complete independent connection system where MEET, Networking, Mentorship, and Jobs maintain separate interaction contexts while users remain discoverable across all sections.

## Four Key Requirements Implemented

### 1. Independent Swipe Actions
- MEET likes/dislikes don't affect Networking/Mentorship/Jobs swipe cards
- Each context uses separate database tables:
  - `matches` - MEET dating connections
  - `suite_networking_connections` - Professional networking
  - `suite_mentorship_connections` - Mentor-mentee relationships
  - `suite_job_applications` - Job applications

### 2. Cross-App User Availability
- Users appear as discoverable across all app sections regardless of existing matches
- Discovery algorithms filter by connection type, not global user interaction
- Same user can be liked/matched in multiple contexts simultaneously

### 3. Multiple Chat Contexts
- Each relationship type maintains separate messaging streams
- MEET match = messaging via `/api/messages`
- Networking match = messaging via `/api/suite/messages` (networking context)
- Mentorship match = messaging via `/api/suite/messages` (mentorship context)
- Job application = messaging via `/api/suite/messages` (job context)

### 4. Unified Message Button Behavior
- Message button works consistently across all swipe card types
- Creates instant match in appropriate table based on context:
  - MEET: Creates match with `matched: true` in `matches` table
  - Networking: Creates connection with `matched: true` in `suite_networking_connections`
  - Mentorship: Creates connection with `matched: true` in `suite_mentorship_connections`
  - Jobs: Creates application with `status: 'accepted'` in `suite_job_applications`

## API Endpoints

### Unified Message Endpoint
- `POST /api/suite/connections/message`
- Handles instant match creation for all SUITE contexts
- Parameters: `{ targetUserId, connectionType, profileId }`
- Returns instant match with messaging capability

### Context-Specific Endpoints
- `POST /api/suite/connections/networking` - Networking likes/passes
- `POST /api/suite/connections/mentorship` - Mentorship connections
- `GET /api/suite/connections/{type}` - Get connections by type
- `DELETE /api/suite/connections/{type}/{id}` - Remove connections

## Database Schema

### Independent Tables
Each connection type maintains separate schema optimized for its context:

```sql
-- MEET dating connections
matches: userId1, userId2, matched, isDislike, lastMessageAt

-- Professional networking
suite_networking_connections: userId, targetProfileId, targetUserId, action, matched

-- Mentorship relationships  
suite_mentorship_connections: userId, targetProfileId, targetUserId, action, matched

-- Job applications
suite_job_applications: userId, targetProfileId, targetUserId, action, status
```

## Real-time Features

### WebSocket Events
- `suite_message_match` - Instant match notifications
- `suite_networking_notification` - Professional connection alerts
- `suite_mentorship_notification` - Mentorship match alerts
- Cross-context notifications don't interfere with each other

### Cache Management
- Independent query invalidation per connection type
- `/api/suite/connections/networking` cache separate from mentorship
- MEET matches cache independent from all SUITE connections

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: No cross-contamination between relationship contexts
2. **Performance**: Targeted queries without complex filtering
3. **Scalability**: Each context can evolve independently
4. **User Experience**: Clear separation of professional vs personal connections
5. **Messaging Clarity**: Distinct chat contexts prevent confusion

## Testing Scenarios

1. User likes someone on MEET → Should not affect networking discovery
2. User matches in networking → Should not affect mentorship availability
3. User messages via networking → Creates networking-specific chat thread
4. User has 3 different relationship types with same person → 3 separate chat contexts

## Implementation Status

✅ Unified message endpoint for all SUITE contexts
✅ Independent database tables with proper schemas
✅ Context-specific connection creation
✅ Real-time WebSocket notifications
✅ Storage methods for all connection types
✅ Cross-context user availability maintained
✅ Message button consistency across all swipe cards
